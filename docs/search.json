    "text": "Research\nMy research areas include causal inference, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I am particularly interested in developing methods for estimating causal effects in observational studies and understanding the implications of model assumptions on causal inference. Specifically, I am interested in the application of machine learning methods to causal inference problems, including the use of machine learning algorithms for estimating treatment effects and the development of new methods for assessing the robustness of causal conclusions to model assumptions. I have also worked on the intersection of machine learning and information theory, exploring how information-theoretic principles can be used to improve the robustness of machine learning models, and how machine learning can be used for error correction using natural redundancy.\n#Curriculum\n#Learning Notes"

    "text": "My research philosophy centers on the belief that chaos, while seemingly random, contains a lot of inherent nonlinear order. My research efforts are driven by the quest to understand and explore this order through multidisciplinary approaches, with the help of mathematical and statistical learning tools such as information theory, causal inference, and machine learning. In healthcare, I’ve applied causal learning to analyze sepsis outcomes and investigated causal structure learning models using real-world data. My past work includes analyzing treatment effects of various drugs on Alzheimer’s and other conditions using nationwide claim data in the United States.\nDuring my Ph.D., I focused on the intersection of machine learning and information theory in the context of data storage. My research involved hardware implementation of DNNs, exploring coded construction and leveraging natural redundancy for enhanced data reliability.\nI am keen on exploring chaotic systems in other areas such as finance, and try to make sense of chaos and filter out the meaningful signals from noisy data."
